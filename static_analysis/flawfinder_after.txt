decomp/Decompiled.c:26:  [4] (format) printf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification.

  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification.
